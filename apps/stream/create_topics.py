"""
Create Kafka topics used by the speed layer.

Topics:
  - raw_events      (3 partitions) — raw job events from the producer
  - raw_events_dlq  (1 partition)  — dead-letter queue for malformed events

Kafka fundamentals first:
A topic is like a named stream of messages.
A producer writes messages into a topic.
A consumer reads messages from a topic.
A partition splits a topic into parallel lanes so multiple consumers or tasks can read faster.
replication_factor=1.This means each partition has only one copy.
A DLQ (dead-letter queue) is a separate topic where broken or malformed events are sent instead of crashing the main pipeline.
